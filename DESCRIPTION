Title: Calling somatic SVs in exome DNA-sequencing data (SV2 version)
Version: 0.6.19

Description: Small structural variations (SV) are genetic mutations that
    comprise between 50 and 300 nucleotides. Somatic mutations in a tumor context occur
    in tumor cells but not in healthy cells. This package focusses on finding small
    somatic SVs within tumor/normal exome sequencing data.
